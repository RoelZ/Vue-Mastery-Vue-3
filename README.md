In this Vue Mastery course, we’ll be building a production-level app using Vue 3. We’ll start off by creating the project using the Vue CLI. Then we’ll learn about single file .vue components and how they can be used to create a single page application. We’ll cover the fundamentals of Vue Router so we can navigate between the different views of our app, and we’ll even fetch real external data using API calls with Axios. We’ll end by learning about the build process and how to deploy our app into production.

If you don’t know the fundamentals of Vue.js syntax you can follow along, but in case you’ll want to learn the fundamentals you could check out [Vue Mastery's Intro to Vue 3 course](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/components-and-props-vue3).

If you’re ready to build a Real World Vue 3 app, I’ll see you in the rest of the course.
